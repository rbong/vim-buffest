COMMANDS                                                    *buffest-commands*

All commands can be mapped using <Plug> and the name of the command.
See |using-<Plug>|.

*:Regsplit* *:Regvsplit* *:Regtabedit* *:Regedit*

Each of these commands takes one argument, the name of the register.
Each command opens the register in the way indicated.
Only the named registers, as well as {*}, {+}, and {"} are supported.

*:Qflistsplit* *:Qflistvsplit* *Qflisttabedit* *Qflistedit*

Each of these commands open the quickfix list in the way indicated.
These commands support |buffest-list-fields|.

*:Loclistsplit* *:Loclistvsplit* *Loclisttabedit* *Locflistedit*

Each of these commands open the location list in the way indicated.
These commands support |buffest-list-fields|.
The window always splits using |:aboveleft| and sets the loclist of |winnr()| + 1.

LIST FIELDS                                              *buffest-list-fields*

All list commands can optionally take in field arguments.
If this list of fields is given, only those fields will be shown in output.
The unlisted fields will be lost.

The fields will be shown sorted.

The supported fields are based on |getqflist()|, |setqflist()|, |setloclist()|, and |getloclist()|.
The supported fields are as follows:
'filename', 'module', 'lnum', 'pattern', 'col', 'vcol', 'nr', 'text', 'type',  and 'valid'.

If 'valid' is excluded from the fields, invalid items will be filtered.

Other fields excluded will result in the field reverting to its default value.
Notably, if 'vcol' is excluded from the fields, all 'col' fields will be converted to byte index.

USING BUFFERS                                                *buffest-buffers*

On re-opening a buffer it will automatically update from the register or list.

Normal updating: >
  :e

Force update: >
  :e!

Buffers will automatically write to the register or list.

Write buffer: >
  :w

Write register in a specific visual mode (defaults to |linewise|): >
  V:<C-U>w
  v:<C-U>w
  <C-V>:<C-U>w

Write and exit: >
  :wq
Alternative: >
  ZZ

MAPPINGS                                                    *buffest-mappings*

All mappings can be overriden by setting the corresponding <Plug> setting.

c@{regname}                                                  *buffest-c@* *c@*

Edit the register in a split (<Plug>Regsplit).

c@@                                                        *buffest-c@@* *c@@*

Edit the {"} register in a split.
Only set when the default register mapping is set.

c,q                                                        *buffest-c,q* *c,q*

Edit the quickfix list in a split (<Plug>Qflistsplit).

c,l                                                        *buffest-c,l* *c,l*

Edit the location list in a split (<Plug>Loclistsplit).
